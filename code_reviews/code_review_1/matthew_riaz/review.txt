THINGS YOU DID FABULOUSLY:
* You created a routine for each of the query types.
* In general, you had self-documenting method names.
* You had really helpful comments in your code.

SUGGESTIONS:
* print_years is a bit of a misnomer as you aren't actually printing years.
* Your main() routine seems to be doing a lot. Maybe try splitting it into smaller   routines?
