THINGS YOU DID FANTASTICALLY:
* You created separate routines for the title, author, and year filters.
* You made sure to provide a lot of detail in setting the help statement for each argument, and I really appreciated that.

SUGGESTIONS:
* I think using a uniform naming convention for functions and variables would enhance readability. 
  For example, either use camel case or underscores to denote names with more than one word.
* There may be too much happening in the main() function. Maybe split parts of it up into separate routines.
