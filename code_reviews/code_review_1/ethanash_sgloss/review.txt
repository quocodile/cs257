WORDS OF PRAISE:
* You did a FANTASTIC job commenting your code. It is easy to understand what your routines are supposed to do.
* I love how your title(), author(), and years() subroutine are all 
SUGGESTIONS:
* You could alleviate the text in your comments by using self-documenting routine names. For example, the routine name "years" could be changed to "QueryBooksByPublicationYear". 
* The main() routine is a bit long. A possible way to improve is by dividing some of the stuff into their own separate, smaller routines.
